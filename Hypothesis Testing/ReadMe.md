The script currently tests for the following:

1. When given the parameter 'predictor' we select for the predictor of main interest from the model. This will grab all combinations of this predictor. Additional, we have the parameter 'beta' which is beta0, when set to 0 we test for the two-sided null-alternative hypothesis, additionally we can have any value here other than zero if we wish to test for alternative hypotheses. This will include the P-value to test for significance.
