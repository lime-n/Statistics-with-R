# Statistics-with-R
A public library that will allow for automatic hypothesis testing on predictors.

The following will be achieved:
1. ~~Get all combinations of a model, grab the t-statistic and p-value for the t-statistic.~~
2. ~~Next step, set an additional parameter to test for the null hypothesis.~~
3. From this, get the entire models F-statistic and P-value at the F-statistic.
4. Develop a function to calculate various hypotheses based on the current linear model coefficients
5. Additionally, develop a function that can make additional predictions and hypotheses on this plus a confidence interval.
